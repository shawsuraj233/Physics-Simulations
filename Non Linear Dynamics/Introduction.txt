Nonlinear dynamics is a mathematical concept that describes how systems change over time in a nonlinear manner. In nonlinear systems, the behavior of a system is described by equations that do not follow a linear relationship. For example, in nonlinear systems, the response to two inputs applied simultaneously is not the same as the sum of the responses to the two inputs applied individually. Nonlinear systems can also exhibit autonomous oscillations that may continue for minutes, hours, days, or longer, and may start and stop abruptly. These sudden changes are referred to as bifurcations. 
Nonlinear dynamics can be seen as a sub-field of complex systems, which can be a good place for physicists interested in complexity to start. Nonlinear dynamics has applications in many areas.
